# Ghosts-Within - An Interactive Fiction Game made with TADS 3

# Purpose
This IF game was created as part for my Diploma thesis for the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Patras, Greece! 

# Abstract
The term interactive fiction (IF for short) is at the intersection of two seemingly unrelated subjects: programming and literature. The result is a novel, which interacts with the reader in such a way that the main plot is being progressed directly or indirectly by their actions. 
The aim of this academic thesis is to create and evaluate an interactive fiction game using modern authoring tools, with the ultimate goal of submitting it to the annual global competition called "The Interactive Fiction Competition". The game was constructed using TADS 3, an authoring system suitable for developers, who fancy programming and after the completion of its first phase of beta-testing it was thoroughly evaluated by a carefully selected team through the Heuristics Evaluation for Playability Method (HEP).


# Notice
Unfortunately, you are out of luck! The game cannot and will not be uploaded here, until the Interactive Fiction Competition has been completed.
Thank you for taking the time to check out my game!
